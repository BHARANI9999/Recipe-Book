            1.
            All you need to do is keep adding the ingredients one by one in a large mixing bowl in the following order: Yeast, Sugar, Milk, Egg, Flour, Butter, Salt, Garlic powder. Keep stirring with the help of a strong wooden spatula.</p><br>
            
           <p> 2.
            The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Keep stirring until the dough comes together & it does not stick to the bowl any more. Should take about 15 minutes. *A stand mixer with the Dough Hook can be used.</p><br>
            
            <p>3.
                Transfer the dough to a clean bowl. Cover tightly with cling wrap.</p><br>
            
            <p>4.
                Let it rest for about 90 minutes. (1st Proofing).</p><br>
            
            <p>5.
                Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface.</p><br>
            
            <p>6.Shape into a ball. Flatten it.</p><br>
            <p>7.Cut into eight equal portions with the help of a serrated knife Or a sharp knife. Roll out into long strips. Roll the strips into oval buns.            </p><br>
            <p>8.Arrange in a baking dish lined with greased parchment paper.            </p><br>
            <p>9.Cover & let it rest for another 30 minutes. (2nd Proofing).            </p><br>
            <p>10.Preheat oven for 10 minutes at 180 Degree C/350 Degree F.            </p><br>
            <p>11.Brush generously with egg wash (Beaten egg).                .</p><br>

            <p>13.Note: 1. I have used American Cups Measurements.            </p><br>
            <p>14.2. Please use either a 13 X 9 Inches Rectangular Baking Dish Or a 10.5 Inches Round Baking Dish Or a Cast Iron Pan as I have used here.            </p><br>
